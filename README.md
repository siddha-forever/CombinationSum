# CombinationSum

Given a distinct array of integers called "candidates" and a target integer called "target," your task is to find and return a list of all unique combinations of numbers from the candidates array, where the chosen numbers sum up to the target. You can use any number from the candidates array an unlimited number of times in each combination. Two combinations are considered unique if they differ in the frequency of at least one chosen number.

Example:

Input: Candidates: [2, 3, 5] Target: 8

Output: [[2, 2, 2, 2], [2, 3, 3], [3, 5]]
